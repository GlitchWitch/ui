import * as React from 'react';
import { mdx } from '@mdx-js/react';
import { DefaultLayout } from '~/mdx-layout';
export default DefaultLayout;

### Tokens

The Tokens are split in different components:

- `typography`: fonts families
- `colors`: colors, variants, and helpers
- `borders`: borders and radius
- `opacity`: transparency values
- `shadows`: shadows effects
- `spacing`: relative and absolute spaces

### Tailwind CSS Theme

All tokens are declared in the [Tailwind CSS Theme Config](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration) syntax by exporting them in dedicated objects, e.g.:

```ts
export const typography = {
  fontFamily: {
    code: ['Consolas', 'SFMono-Regular', 'Monaco', 'monospace'],
  },
  fontWeight: {
    custom: '600',
  },
};
```

Then all tokens definitions are merged in the `~/theme/` component to build the global Tailwind CSS `theme.extend` definition. This `theme` is used in the `tailwind.config.js` file directly to setup all the classes and variants.

## Components

Components can exploit the Tailwind CSS atomic classes directly:

```jsx
<button
  className={`
    ${active ? 'bg-purple-500 text-white' : 'text-grey-900'}
    flex items-center w-full px-2 py-2
    group rounded-md
    text-sm
  `}
>
  Click Me!
</button>
}
```

## Stories

Stories are written in Storybook's [Component Story Format](https://backlight.dev/docs/component-story-format). Components' stories are located in their `stories/` folder.

## Documentation

Documentation pages are decorated by a React layout using the [@divriots/dockit-react](https://github.com/divriots/dockit-react) helpers. See the `mdx-layout` component.

### Pages

Each component embed its own documentation in its `doc/` folder. You can use any web format for your documentation but we recommend you to write it with the [mdx](https://backlight.dev/docs/mdx) format, allowing you to embed your components live in the documentation.
